 application which will be a GPS tracker connected to an ambulance. In many situations we have seen that the ambulance doesn't reach some places on time as the place might be difficult to find, so by creating an application through which the ambulance and the person called for ambulance gets and idea of where the ambulance is and not only that application tells you where the ambulance is but until it arrives it also tells you what first aid can you give it to the patient at the moment so as to keep the person alive until he reaches the hospital.
